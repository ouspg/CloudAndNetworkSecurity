## About the lab

* **You are encouraged to use your own computer or virtual machine if you want.** However, the use of a Linux machine is necessary. 
* Check the deadline from Moodle and __remember that you have to return your name (and possibly people you worked together with) and GitHub repository information to Moodle before the deadline.__


## Background

This week’s theme focuses on cloud security.

Cloud security refers to the set of practices, technologies, and policies designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure hosted in cloud environments. With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, ensuring the security of cloud-based resources has become paramount for organizations of all sizes.

Key aspects of cloud security include:

1) Authentication and Access Control: Cloud security protocols implement mechanisms to verify the identity of users and devices accessing cloud services. This involves employing strong authentication methods such as multifactor authentication (MFA) and enforcing granular access controls to restrict privileges based on user roles and responsibilities.

2) Data Encryption: Encrypting data both in transit and at rest is essential for safeguarding sensitive information stored in the cloud. Encryption algorithms are utilized to encode data, ensuring that even if intercepted, it remains unintelligible to unauthorized parties.

3) Compliance and Regulatory Requirements: Cloud security measures must align with industry-specific regulations and compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. Adhering to these standards helps ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored in the cloud while mitigating legal and financial risks.

4) Threat Detection and Incident Response: Cloud security protocols employ advanced monitoring and threat detection tools to identify suspicious activities and potential security breaches in real-time. Prompt incident response strategies are implemented to mitigate the impact of security incidents and restore normal operations swiftly.

5) Infrastructure Protection: Securing the underlying infrastructure of cloud platforms is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. This involves implementing firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and security patches to fortify cloud-based servers, networks, and storage resources.

Common cloud security technologies and protocols include Identity and Access Management (IAM), Transport Layer Security (TLS), Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

## Task 1, Option B: Analyse the Kubernetes environment (1p)

In the following task 2, we provide a Kubernetes cluster, which includes a lot of different services.
The cluster has only a single node and this node contains multiple deployments and other controllers.
In Kubernetes, we talk a lot about pods; they **are essentially one or more OCI containers from the previous week.** 
A group of containers that are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. 

Check the basic [overview description](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/) about Kubernetes, its [components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/), and [cluster architecture](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/).
Many fancy systems that cloud providers offer, are based on the Kubernetes underneath.

It is useful to get more knowledge about how Kubernetes and `kubectl` works, if you don't have any yet.
You can already start setting up the cluster on this task, and your job is to discover what components this cluster contains.

Instead of using the script to launch the services, you can check the script contents and run them one by one.

*Note that not all the services or deployments have relations with each other.*

Essentially, all you need is `kubectl` command to operate with a cluster.  `kubectl` is a client which operates with Kubernetes API, which is in the master node, as part of *the control plane*.

Check for relevant [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands).
The most important commands are `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` to make an understanding of the clusters.

For example, to get good overview of the single pod, you can run `kubectl describe pod <podname>`.

You need to **produce a graph about the provided cluster architecture**, and 

* Briefly explain what is an Ingress controller and describe what access points it is exposing to the public.
* Briefly explain what Services are, what is their relation to pods, and what is exposed to the Ingress controller or otherwise made accessible from outside in this cluster.
* What pods are running in the cluster?
* Think about different attack surfaces on this cluster, based on all the previous ones.

If you want to integrate graphs directly into GitHub, check [Mermaid syntax](https://mermaid.js.org/), its [live tool](https://mermaid.live) and [how to use with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams).

## Task 2: Poor Web Application (1p)

In cloud development, environment variables play a crucial role in configuring and customizing applications and services deployed in cloud environments. Environment variables are dynamic values that can affect the behaviour of software applications without changing their codebase.
They provide a flexible and portable way to manage configuration settings across different deployment environments, such as development, testing, and production.

This task involves intentionally vulnerable Kubernetes deployments and services that you are to exploit using a multitude of tools such as `ffuf` or `gobuster` and a tool to access the database from outside the Kubernetes cluster. The idea is to get deeper and deeper into the system as you progress through the stages and use the information found during the task to find different flags. This task can be completed on both Linux and Windows machines, but it is easier to use the tools with a UNIX operating system, and there are shell scripts for creating the environment in Bash. You can use any tool of your choice for managing the Kubernetes cluster, but the course staff recommends using Kind for this as it is what the task is developed with. 

You can read more about the tools used during this task at:
* **Kind** - [Kind documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
* **Helm** - [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/)
* **`ffuf`** - [`ffuf` GitHub repo](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)

### Deploying the laboratory environment

First make sure that you have installed Docker, `kubectl`, Helm and Go on your machine. Also, make sure to have your Docker engine or Docker desktop running.

To install `kubectl` on the course machine, simply run `pacman -Sy kubectl`

Then you can run the following command to install Kind:

```bash
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.22.0
```
After you have successfully installed the aforementioned software, you can then run the:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

script from the CloudAndNetworkSecurity/5. Cloud Security/ directory to deploy all the Kubernetes resources.
Wait for the Kubernetes pods to be in Running and READY states, this should take 10-15 minutes at maximum depending on how powerful your machine is.
You can monitor this with:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

When you have all the pods in a **Running** and **READY X/X** states, you can then use the following script to port forward the necessary resources for access on the 127.0.0.1:

```bash
./access.sh
```
Confirm that you can access the URL: http://localhost:1230
If you managed to access the URL, then you have successfully deployed the laboratory environment! :boom:

### Getting DNS to work

1. Identify the cluster IP
2. Modify the `/etc/hosts` file as follows, based on the cluster IP (127.0.0.1 example works for Kind)

```text
127.0.0.1 keycloak.kyber.local
127.0.0.1 blog.kyber.local
127.0.0.1 company.kyber.local
127.0.0.1 system-monitor.kyber.local
127.0.0.1 health.kyber.local
127.0.0.1 internal-proxy.kyber.local
```
**provide the screenshot of accessing the http://localhost:1230 and keycloak.kyber.local URL**

>[!Note]
> You can delete all the resources later by running the command "kind delete cluster --name kind-cloudsec"

### Finding hidden endpoints

There are some hidden endpoints in the web application, your first task is to find these endpoints. You can use `ffuf` or `gobuster` to find these endpoints. The course staff has provided you with a wordlist for using these tools in this repository. 

Document how many endpoints you found and describe if there is anything interesting in those endpoints and if they could be potentially exploited.

**Provide the commands used to find hidden endpoints.**

### Getting access to the database

You should have found an endpoint that points to a database and another that lists the internal filesystem of the pod running the web application.
However, it seems there are some files hidden when accessing the endpoint directly via the front end. Your next task is to find environment variables from the filesystem that could be used to access the database endpoint, one instance in the database contains a flag.

**You should find two flags during this process. Document your process and include the flags.**

### Accessing the database with superuser credentials from remote

It seems you have gained access to one table in the database that the frontend points to previously, now your task is to access the database with the admin credentials from outside the Kubernetes cluster. For this you need to find a suitable client to connect to the database, you can extract more information about the database with the `kubectl` commands to figure out which kind of client you need for this.

**Provide the command you used to access the database from outside the Kubernetes cluster and the flag that is found in another table in the database.**

## Task 3: Perform Kubernetes Goat tutorials (1p)

In this task, you'll complete two Kubernetes Goat tutorials and answer key questions. 

As stated on the official website: “Kubernetes Goat is an interactive Kubernetes security learning playground. It has intentionally vulnerable by design scenarios to showcase the common misconfigurations, real-world vulnerabilities, and security issues in Kubernetes clusters, containers, and cloud-native environments.”

Useful resources:
1. The main website of Kubernetes Goat. Click [here](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/)
2. GitHub of Kubernetes Goat. Click [here](https://github.com/madhuakula/kubernetes-goat)

>[!Important]
> You'll use the deployment from task 2 to complete these tutorials.
> Provided tutorials are one way to complete the tasks. You can try different approaches and commands too.

### A) Perform tutorial: SSRF in the Kubernetes (K8S) world

The tutorial can be accessed [here.](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/scenarios/scenario-3/ssrf-in-the-kubernetes-world/welcome/)

To get started with the scenario, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1232 or https://internal-proxy.kyber.local

To complete this scenario, you need to obtain the k8s-goat-FLAG flag value in the metadata secrets.

To obtain full marks, add the required screenshots and answer questions in the end

Add the following screenshots as your answer:
1. When you query port 5000 in the same container http://127.0.0.1:5000 with method GET
2. When you query http://metadata-db with method GET
3. When you query http://metadata-db/latest/secrets/kubernetes-goat with the method GET

Copy and paste your flag and decode it. 

**Provide command used** 

**Copy and paste your decoded flag**

**What do you understand about Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the Kubernetes world after completing this tutorial?**

### B) Perform tutorial: Docker CIS benchmarks analysis

Tutorial can be accessed [here](https://madhuakula.com/kubernetes-goat/docs/scenarios/scenario-5/docker-cis-benchmarks-in-kubernetes-containers/welcome/)

To get started with the scenario, you can deploy the Docker CIS benchmarks Daemon Set using the following command. Notice that this command is slightly different from the tutorial.

```
kubectl apply -f deployments/docker-bench/docker-bench-security.yaml
```

To exec into the pod, run the following command. Make sure to replace the pod name with correct one.

```
kubectl exec -it docker-bench-security-xxxxx -- sh
```

The goal of this scenario is to perform the Docker CIS benchmark audit and obtain the results from the audit.

To obtain full marks, add the required screenshots and answer questions in the end

Add the following screenshots as your answer:
1. When you execute `sh docker-bench-security.sh`
2. When you obtain the final benchmark results

**Why Docker CIS benchmarks is useful? How could it help improve the overall security of the cloud infrastructure?**

## Task 4: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (2p)

The idea of [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) is used a lot in modern web and cloud-based services. 
In short, you use a single account to log in to different platforms or services, at once.
For example, consider a scenario when you log in to a Google service such as Gmail, you are automatically authenticated to YouTube and other Google apps.

The above, and most of the other modern authentication in web, mobile devices, API endpoints and other cloud native environments are mainly based on [OAuth 2.0 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) and its extension [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/).

The older common protocol, [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language), is still prevalent in many enterprise environments, while OAuth 2.0-based protocols are starting to slowly replace them.

OAuth 2.0 provides the authorization framework, whereas OpenID Connect adds authentication and identity verification part. Essentially, they federate together authentication scenarios.

In this task, we try to make some simple implementations in the Kubernetes environment.
Especially, focusing only on the most common Authorization Code Flow. 
See some documentation about the flow below.

* Curity [docs](https://curity.io/resources/learn/openid-code-flow/)
* Microsoft [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow)
* Authorization Code Flow in [standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)
* [OAuth vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth)

**Complete the playground** flow [here](https://www.oauth.com/playground/oidc.html) to get a practical overview of the flow.

### Task 4A) Playing around with WordPress and OpenID Connect (0.5p)

The cluster has a well-known open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) system [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) deployed. 
It is not configured to work with any of the services yet, but there are two potential use cases.
  * Web application from task 2 in address https://company.kyber.local
  * WordPress blog in address https://blog.kyber.local

Both Keycloak and WordPress can be configured correctly to use OpenID Connect just by using their web GUI, and that is a good starting point to try out the protocol.

*Make sure that you have completed the playground already in the oauth.com site*.

To access Keycloak, use the URL https://keycloak.kyber.local
Credentials are `admin:admin`.

Check Keycloak [docs about OpenID Connect.](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#con-oidc_server_administration_guide)
By default, most things work already.

To check that OpenID works, see the JSON in URL [https://keycloak.kyber.local/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration](https://keycloak.kyber.local/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration)

This same URL can be found in the realm settings, bottom left. You see that the server has `master` realm configured.
To make the server useful, you need to create some users and add clients. 
We will try out WordPress first.

To log in to the WordPress site, navigate to https://blog.kyber.local/wp-login.php

* Username: username
* Password: password

The workflow is something like the following:
  * Create an example user to Keycloak (Also add a password for it)
  * Create a new client (WordPress in this case) for Keycloak which can then use the Keycloak for authentication and authorization
	  * You should enable authentication and authorization when creating the client. Standard flow is selected by default.
	  * As we create it for WordPress alone, we can use the URL https://blog.kyber.local/ for every section in this case.
	  * For the redirect URL, you *might need to use a wildcard suffix*.
	  * Check the client secret that you need when you configure the WordPress.
  * Now, you can configure the WordPress to use Keycloak for authentication
	  * It has a plugin installed as "miniOrange Auth"; just add a new application.
	  * Get the valid URLs from the previously mentioned JSON URL.
  * After the test is finished, you can try to log in again. “Login with Keycloak” should appear, and you can try out the earlier created test user. You will notice that it will acquire basic information from Keycloak and does not have anything specific permissions after logging in.

> Provide a screenshot from succeed test case of the OAuth plugin.


### Task 4B) Implementing the flow by yourself (1p)

> [!Note]
> Basic implementation for this task takes only few lines of code in practice. Do not be too intimidated!

Now, we will continue with the web application from task 2, which uses the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) framework internally.
You should add a new client in Keycloak for it.
Since Flask uses server-side rendering to provide the client in the browser for the end-user, we have strong assumptions that we can keep the client secret as a secret, and get the token by using the POST method.

We try to keep this task rather simple; we just want to finish the flow somewhat correctly and obtain the authentication token, which can be used to access content from some resource server on behalf of the end-user (we don't access).
You want just to get some profile information from the Keycloak server as part of the JWT token.

You should get pretty far by following the request flow [here.](https://curity.io/resources/learn/openid-code-flow/)
The flow is rather short and you need [only the requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on top of Flask and some std libraries to complete the flow.

In short, you need to modify `login` and `callback` routes on the Flask server. 
Note that the initial URL for the authorization server needs to be generated first and it will be passed to `login.html` template.
If you have created the client configuration correctly for the Keycloak server, you should get started from the initial response.

You can find partial source code and other things in the [flask](flask) directory. Note that this is not the complete code that was used in task 2. The database usage is not included.

> [!Note]
> Open browser in private mode to see that you indeed need to enter the credentials and it redirects back to your Flask app! You can try the same user as you did with Wordpress.

### Development environment

We don't need to deploy to Kubernetes to try out the flow, as we can access the DNS address from the browser and redirect URLs are handled in the browser context.
We just need a local Python environment.

Create a new virtual environment and activate it
```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Then just start 
python app.py
```
Find the new app from http://localhost:3000

> Return the modified source code and add the screenshot of success!

### Task 4C) Make a small security analysis for your implementation (0.5p)

Check the common issues from [PortSwigger on OAuth 2.0 implementations](https://portswigger.net/web-security/oauth).

Do you think that your Python implementation was good? What issues there are?

What is the role of state and nonce in the flow?

How would the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) improve security?

It was originally intended for mobile use only, but it appeared to be good for general use, and [OAuth 2.1 will make it mandatory](https://oauth.net/2.1/). Explain the benefits and potential risk scenarios it is mitigating.
